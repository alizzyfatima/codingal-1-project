<h2> plot</h2>
<p>In a world where supernatural abilities are the norm, Paedyn Gray is an Ordinaryâ€”someone with no powers. She survives by pretending to be a Psychic, using her wits and combat skills to navigate the dangerous slums. When Paedyn is captured and brought to the palace, she meets Prince Malakai "Kai" Azer, who can use anyone's power within his reach. Their encounter sets off a chain of events that challenges the existing power dynamics and reveals hidden truths about their world.

    As Paedyn and Kai's relationship develops, they confront their own beliefs about power, identity, and freedom. Paedyn's journey becomes one of self-discovery and resistance against the oppressive regime led by the king, who has ordered the elimination of the powerless Ordinaries.
    
    Through alliances, battles, and personal growth, Paedyn and Kai strive to bring justice and change to their society, ultimately questioning what it means to be truly powerful.
